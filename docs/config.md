# Configuration

For basic configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

For advanced configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced).

For a full configuration reference, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

## Connecting to MCP servers

Codex can connect to MCP servers configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`. See the configuration reference for the latest MCP server options:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

## Apps (Connectors)

Use `$` in the composer to insert a ChatGPT connector; the popover lists accessible
apps. The `/apps` command lists available and installed apps. Connected apps appear first
and are labeled as connected; others are marked as can be installed.

## Notify

Codex can run a notification hook when the agent finishes a turn. See the configuration reference for the latest notification settings:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

When Codex knows which client started the turn, the legacy notify JSON payload also includes a top-level `client` field. The TUI reports `codex-tui`, and the app server reports the `clientInfo.name` value from `initialize`.

## Agent Inbox Delivery

By default, inbound messages from other agents are delivered to non-subagent threads as normal
user input. If you want those handoffs to appear as explicit non-user transcript activity, you can
opt into a synthetic function-call/function-call-output envelope:

```toml
[features]
agent_function_call_inbox = true
```

When enabled, Codex injects inbound agent messages into non-subagent threads as an `agent_inbox`
function-call/function-call-output pair. This is primarily a model-behavior workaround for cases
where you want a subagent handoff to start a valid turn while still being clearly marked as
non-user activity in the transcript.

Messages sent to subagents continue to arrive as normal user input.

## Watchdog Interval

Watchdog agents use the top-level `watchdog_interval_s` setting to decide how long the owner thread
must be idle before a check-in helper is spawned when the `agent_watchdog` feature is enabled.

```toml
watchdog_interval_s = 60
```
## JSON Schema

The generated JSON Schema for `config.toml` lives at `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`.

## SQLite State DB

Codex stores the SQLite-backed state DB under `sqlite_home` (config key) or the
`CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` environment variable. When unset, WorkspaceWrite sandbox
sessions default to a temp directory; other modes default to `CODEX_HOME`.

## Notices

Codex stores "do not show again" flags for some UI prompts under the `[notice]` table.

## Plan mode defaults

`plan_mode_reasoning_effort` lets you set a Plan-mode-specific default reasoning
effort override. When unset, Plan mode uses the built-in Plan preset default
(currently `medium`). When explicitly set (including `none`), it overrides the
Plan preset. The string value `none` means "no reasoning" (an explicit Plan
override), not "inherit the global default". There is currently no separate
config value for "follow the global default in Plan mode".

Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D quitting uses a ~1 second double-press hint (`ctrl + c again to quit`).
